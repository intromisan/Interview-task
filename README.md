# Interview-task for Tenengroup Ltd.

Task: 

Please create a mobile web page as the design attached - webpage.jpg (html + css).
You need to build it as accurately as possible according to the design.

General instructions:
  1. Please use for the logo the image attached - logo.png
  2. For the other icons - please use font-awesome icons.
  3. Text font should be 'Ubuntu' (Google font).

Functionality (js):
  1. When you click on the first pink line ('Received Item Issues'), a sub menu displayed (with sliding
  effect), when click it again the menu closes - see attached - webpage_menu_open.jpg
  2. When you open the page for the second time – a popup appears, and if you close it with the ‘x’
  button or you click on the gray overlay – you won’t see the popup again – see attached -
  webpage_popup.jpg
  3. Bonus – create the reviews area (the bottom of the page) as slides with auto rotation instead of
  one under the other (do it with your own code – no libraries or plugins...)

You can use jQuery in this test, but no other libraries.
Good luck!
